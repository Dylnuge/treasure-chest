<h2>Creating an Account</h2>

<p>
An <em>account</em> is a virtual representation of money organization.
Accounts may exist in the real world, they may be virtual accounts
(such as money allocated or equity), or they may be invoice accounts
(accounts payable and receivable).
</p>

<p>
You are free to use accounts however you like to structure things in
whatever manner seems appropriate to your organization. To manage accounts,
go to the accounts tab.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Transaction</h2>

<p>
To move money between (or into) accounts, you need a <em>transaction</em>.
Transactions are entities representing the transfer of cash from one account
to another, and the only way to update account balances. In proper
double-entry booking style, any transaction must have both an account
it comes out of and an account it goes into. It is appropriate to maintain
"external" accounts like income, expenditure, and equity accounts to
represent money leaving and entering the organization.
</p>

<p>
Managing transactions is done from the account details page. To create a new
transaction, first go to the page of the account you want to move money from,
and click "Create new transaction". Then fill out the details for the
transaction, including which account you want to move money into, the amount of
money you want to move (this must be non-negative&emdash;if you want to move
money into the account, go to the page for the account you want to move money
from), and an optional description for the transaction.
</p>

<p>
You can view transaction details by clicking the details button in the account
details view. From the transaction details page you may see additional
information excluded from the summary page, such as a transaction description
and images. You may also edit the transaction to change the amount, description,
and upload or remove images. You may delete the transaction, but for account
integrity it is not possible to change the accounts on which the transaction
occurred.
</p>

<h2>Group and User Management</h2>

<p>
Permissions in Treasure Chest are controlled through various <em>groups</em>. A
group consists of users, and any user in the group may edit the group to add or
remove members (including themselves, so long as removing themselves does not
bring the group down to zero members).
</p>

<p>
A group by itself does not have any privileges assigned to it, but rather
receives privileges granted to it by individual accounts. Each account may have
account owners and account viewers. If a user is a member of at least one group
that is an account viewer, that user may see the account and <em>all</em>
associated transactions with the account.
</p>

<p>
A user may make a transaction between two accounts if and only if they are
considered owners of both accounts. Users may make a transaction between two
accounts even if they are an owner of one account by means of a different group
than the other account, so long as they are are by some means an owner on both
accounts they intend to move money between.
