<h2>Creating an Account</h2>

<p>
An <em>account</em> is a virtual representation of money organization.
Accounts may exist in the real world, they may be virtual accounts
(such as money allocated or equity), or they may be invoice accounts
(accounts payable and recievable).
</p>

<p>
You are free to use accounts however you like to structure things in
whatever manner seems appropriate to your organization. To manage accounts,
go to the accounts tab.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Transaction</h2>

<p>
To move money between (or into) accounts, you need a <em>transaction</em>.
Transactions are entites representing the transfer of cash from one account
to another, and the only way to update account balances. In proper
double-entry booking style, any transaction must have both an account
it comes out of and an account it goes into. It is appropriate to maintain
"external" accounts like income, expenditure, and equity accounts to
represent money leaving and entering the organization.
</p>

<p>
To manage transactions, go to the transactions tab.
